# Canonical Types Migration Report

## Summary of Changes

- ✅ Fixed 34 files with import paths to use canonical-types
- ✅ Updated enum values in type-migration-matrix.ts
- ✅ Converted type-only imports to regular imports for enums
- ✅ Created more reliable scripts for future migrations

## Files Updated

### Import Paths Updated (34 files)
- Migration orchestrators and engines
- Configuration modules
- AI verification modules
- Shared foundation utilities
- Pattern detection utilities
- Analysis reporting utilities

### Enum Values Updated
- Replaced string literals with enum values in type-migration-matrix.ts
- Mapped enums properly:
  - 'ERROR' → Severity.ERROR
  - 'WARNING' → Severity.WARNING
  - 'INFO' → Severity.INFO
  - 'REACT' → Framework.REACT19
  - 'NEXT' → Framework.NEXTJS15
  - etc.

### Type-only Imports Fixed
- Changed `import type` to `import` for API types in shared-foundation/testing/test-utilities.ts
- Ensures enum values are properly imported as values, not just types

## Next Steps

1. Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors
2. Run tests to ensure functionality still works
3. Consider enabling ESLint rule to enforce canonical types

## Note
This approach uses targeted simple scripts rather than the complex migration script which was having issues.
